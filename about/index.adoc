## Scale Up and Scale Out

Keep ALL of your data—up to 100s of terabytes—instantly available in RAM distributed across any size server array.


### Some key features of the Terracotta Server include:

* **Distributed In-memory Data Management** &ndash;  Manages 10-100x more data in memory than traditional data grids - use _all_ of the RAM you wish.
* **Scalability Without Complexity** &ndash;  Simple configuration to add server instances to meet growing demand and facilitate capacity planning
* **High Availability** &ndash;  Instant failover for continuous uptime and services
* **Configurable Health Monitoring** &ndash;  Terracotta HealthChecker for inter-node monitoring
* **Automatic Node Reconnection** &ndash;  Temporarily disconnected server instances and clients rejoin the cluster without operator intervention

Terracotta actively develops, maintains, and supports Terracotta Server as a professional open source project available under the liberal Terracotta Public License 2.0.  Contributors are welcome to join our community.
