# Contributing


## Welcome aboard!

We welcome your code contributions large and small - but that's not all.

Contributing doesn't always mean having code repository commit access. In fact, some of the best open source contributors never have commit access. In order for Terracotta projects to be successful, we rely on help in many areas other than writing software. These include:

* Submitting bug reports (with patches!)
* Writing documentation (esp. based on common issues in the forums)
* Helping out in the forums


## Recognition

Authorship record of code modules and/or documentation is maintained to give credit where credit is due.

## Submitting Contributions

Do you have a patch for a bug or have you built a great new feature? Or are you excited to help out with features we have on our road-map? Drop us a note on the forum or file a feature enhancement request in our issue tracker and let us know about it. We gladly, and regularly accept contributions. Contributors are given credit for their work, though they must be willing (for licensing purposes) to release copyright of the work. A " https://confluence.terracotta.org/download/attachments/27918462/Terracotta%20Individual%20Contributor%20Agreement%20v4.docx[Contributor Agreement] " document must be filled-out and sent to Terracotta - indicating that you assign the copyright of the work to the project. This document only needs to be filled out once per contributor - not once for each contribution.


## Becoming "Core" Developer

Becoming a core developer on Terracotta projects (with the rights to directly commit/merge into the main repository) is on an invite-only basis. The project leaders look for people who have submitted bug reports (with patches), helped out with writing documentation, stay active in the community forums, or make code contributions. In addition to all these, developers must demonstrate a strong desire to see the project be successful. This is typically done by staying in touch with the project leaders, following up on reported bugs, and generally offering assistance.
